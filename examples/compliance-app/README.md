# Compliance App Example

This example demonstrates a small React application built with Vite and IBM's Carbon Design System.
It showcases several compliance platform features:

- Account opening wizard
- Client risk questionnaire with scoring
- Trade blotter table with simple flagging
- Document vault using the Carbon FileUploader

## Getting started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
# from repository root
cd examples/compliance-app
npm install
yarn dev
```

A small Express API is also included for demonstration:

```bash
yarn server
```

The app will be available at <http://localhost:5173> and the API at <http://localhost:3000>.
